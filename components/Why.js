            Most of the existing portfolio management tools are managed by services that
            don't guarantee complete confidentiality. Even the portfolio tools
            that guarantee don't have a mechanism to exchange and share it with
            other users in a secure manner. We feel that it can be solved with
            the help of a user-controlled profile (Decentralized Identities) and
            an open yet secure way of exchanging messages.
